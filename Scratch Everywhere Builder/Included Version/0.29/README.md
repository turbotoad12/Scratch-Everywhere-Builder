A work-in-progress runtime made in C++ aimed to bring most Scratch 3 projects over to 6-8th-generation console and handheld platforms (and more)!

![Runtime running a Scratch project on Wii U, Wii, and 3DS](docs/demo.gif)
<small>(Game shown is [Hopper Heros](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1184969400/) by pepper-prepper)</small>

## Controls

![Controls](docs/controls.png)

### Mouse

**3DS:** Glide your finger/stylus on the bottom screen to move the mouse, and tap the bottom screen to click.

**Wii U GamePad:** Use the touchscreen on the GamePad.

**Wii Remote:** Use the Wii sensor bar to control the mouse.

**PS Vita:** Use the front touchscreen.

**Other Controllers:** Enter Mouse Mode by holding L. Use the D-pad to move the mouse, and press R to click.

## Unique Features

### 3DS Screen Modes

-   Any scratch project with an unmodified resolution setting will be displayed on the top screen only.
-   If using a modded Scratch client like TurboWarp, you can go into the projects' Advanced Settings and change the resolution.
    -   Setting it to `400x480` will enable both the top and bottom screen.
    -   Setting it to `320x240` will enable only the bottom screen.
    -   Setting it to `400x240` will make the project perfectly fit to the top screen.
    -   NOTE: make sure to click `Store Settings In Project` on TurboWarp to properly apply the settings.

### Wii U Screen Modes

-   Currently, projects display exactly the same on both the TV and the GamePad, and there's no way to change screen modes.

### Audio

-   A sound may take time to load if playing it for the first time.
-   **[Non-3DS Platforms]** If you play any sound from the `Stage`, the sound will play as a `Streamed Sound` and will not need to load.
    -   Only one `Streamed Sound` can be playing at a time, so this is good for things like background music.
    -   **[Wii, GameCube]** `Streamed Sound` is not supported. Any sounds in the `Stage` will load and play like a normal sound.
-   **[Wii, GameCube]** Sounds may fail to load if the length of the sound is too long, or if there's too many sounds loaded at once.
- 	Audio on the **NDS** is currently experimental, and is not recommended to use at this time;
	- Only .wav is supported.
	- All audio must be in Signed 16-bit PCM wav format, with a recommended sample rate of 11025 Hz or below.
	- Only one sound can be playing at a time.

### Framerate

-   When using a modded Scratch client like TurboWarp, you can enable the `60 FPS (Custom FPS)` advanced option, and change the FPS to any value.

### Differently Implemented Blocks

-   The `Username` block returns the 3DS's nickname, and the Wii U's current Mii name.
-   The `Touching __?` block uses simpler box collision, which may lead to projects working incorrectly.
-   The `Stop 'All'` block brings you back to the project menu.

### Special Custom Blocks

Like TurboWarp, we have special custom blocks that only work on SE!. You can find a project containing and explaining them here: https://scratchbox.grady.link/project/K26OtTN2WDJ9

**Project Linking Blocks**

-   `open (____) .sb3`
-   `open (____) .sb3 with data (____)`
-   `received data` (variable)

These blocks make it possible to split a big game into smaller parts (e.g. a main game, a shop, or a cutscene project) and load them as needed. All paths are relative to the `scratch-everywhere` folder, so subfolders must be specified (e.g. `MyGame/main.sb3`).
This helps avoid memory issues, keep projects modular, and makes it easier to manage large
games.

You can find the blocks in this project: https://scratchbox.grady.link/project/twStEkSKjQaH

> [!NOTE]
> In the future, this feature may be replaced by a dedicated extension once extension support is available.

## Limitations

As this is in a very work in progress state, you will encounter many bugs, crashes, and things that will just not work.

**List of Known Limitations:**

-   Text and embedded bitmap images will not show up on vector images containing it.
-   Extensions (e.g. pen and music extensions) are not yet supported.
-   Some blocks may lead to crashing/unintended behavior (Please open an issue if you know of a block that's causing problems).
-   Performance is poor when using many (~50+) clones (memory management issue).
-   **[Wii, Switch, PSP, Vita, PS4]** Cloud Variables aren't currently supported, but likely will be in the future.
-   **[Wii, Wii U, GameCube, Switch]** The first controller connected will be the only one that will work.
-   **[Wii]** If you're using a PAL Wii, you must use 50Hz.
-   **[GameCube]** Cloud Variables will not be supported.
-   **[GameCube, NDS]** These platforms have very little memory, so try to keep projects small.
-   **[NDS]** Dual screen mode will not be supported.
-   **[3DS]** Performace is poor when lots of blocks are running at once.
-   **[3DS]** If you have a bunch of large images, some may not load.
-   **[PSP]** Images cannot be over 512x512.
-   **[Vita]** Back touch will not be supported.
-   **[PS4]** The software keyboard isn't currently supported.

## Unimplemented blocks

-   All say and think blocks ([#393](https://github.com/ScratchEverywhere/ScratchEverywhere/pull/393))
-   Most costume effects;
    -   Only the `Ghost` and `Brightness` costume effects are supported
-   `Pitch` and `Pan left-right` sound effects
-   When loudness > \_\_\_
-   All color touching blocks
-   Loudness

## Roadmap

### Runtime

-   Bug fixing and Scratch parity
-   Get all blocks working
-   Pen support ([#294](https://github.com/ScratchEverywhere/ScratchEverywhere/pull/294))
-   Support most TurboWarp extensions ([#210](https://github.com/ScratchEverywhere/ScratchEverywhere/pull/210))

> [!NOTE]
> For info about planned/unplanned platform support, please check issue [#166](https://github.com/ScratchEverywhere/ScratchEverywhere/issues/166). **Do not** make an issue if your platform is already there.

## Installation

Scratch Everywhere! is Homebrew software and requires a hacked/modded console.
There are two methods to install the runtime:

-   Download the release or nightly build (easy), or
-   Build the file yourself (harder)

> [!NOTE]
> Nightly builds are significantly more unstable than releases and should probably only be used if you are instructed to do so in a bug report or if you know exactly what using nightlies implies.

Place your Scratch projects in `/data/scratch-ps4`, if the folder doesn't exist, create it.

Then it should be as simple as opening the app on your PS4 from the XMB!

## Building

In order to embed a Scratch project in the executable, you'll need to compile the source code.

If you would like to change the name of the app or any other information you can edit one of the Makefiles.

-   **For the 3DS**, you need to edit `Makefile_3ds` and change `APP_TITLE`, `APP_DESCRIPTION` and `APP_AUTHOR` to whatever you please.
-   **For the Wii U**, you need to edit `Makefile_wiiu` and change `APP_NAME`, `APP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION`, `APP_LONG_DESCRIPTION` and `APP_AUTHOR` to whatever you please.
-   **For the Wii**, you need to edit `Makefile_wii` and change anything under `Application Info` to whatever you please.
-   **For the Vita**, you need to edit the properties under `# METADATA/CONFIG` to whatever you please. Do note however, if you're going to use custom LiveArea images, you must run them through `pngquant` (install with your package manager) with `--posterize` set to 4 first before packaging.
-   **For the PS4**, you need to edit `Makefile_ps4` and change anything under `Package metadata` to whatever you please.

#### Docker

The recommended way to compile Scratch Everywhere! is with Docker. 

We have written a step-by-step guide with pictures (for Windows) that explains the build process very simply, you can find it here: https://ScratchEverywhere.github.io/docker
To compile with Docker all you need installed is Docker and Buildx.

-   To compile for the **3DS**, run `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.3ds --target exporter -o . .`.

-   To compile for the **Wii U**, run `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.wiiu --target exporter -o . .`.

-   To compile for the **Wii**, run `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.wii --target exporter -o . .`.

-   To compile for the **GameCube**, run `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.gamecube --target exporter -o . .`.

-   To compile for the **Nintendo Switch** run `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.switch --target exporter -o . .`.

-   To compile for the **Vita**, run `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.vita --target exporter -o . .`.

-   To compile for the **PSP**, run `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.psp --target exporter -o . .`.

-   To compile for the **PS4**, run `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.ps4 --target exporter -o . .`.

#### Manual

> [!WARNING]
> We are currently migrating our build system from standalone Makefiles to a centralized `CMakeLists.txt` so documentation in this section might be outdated.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend using Docker for PS4 because of how absolutely messy the environment is.

If you are compiling with cloud variables, you will need to have DevkitPro's SDKs, [Mist++](https://github.com/ScratchEverywhere/mistpp), and a modified version of libcurl (instructions in mistpp-packages repo) installed.

-   **For the 3DS**, you will need the DevkitARM toolchain and libctru.
    -   If you want to compile with audio support, you will also need a 3DS compiled version of SDL3 and SDL3_mixer. See the [Nightly Build commands](https://github.com/ScratchEverywhere/ScratchEverywhere/blob/main/.github/workflows/nightly-3ds.yml) for a reference on how to compile SDL3 3DS for yourself.
-   **For the Wii U**, you will need the DevkitPPC toolchain, WUT, all SDL2-wiiu libraries, and [libromfs-wiiu.](https://github.com/yawut/libromfs-wiiu).
-   **For the Wii**, you need the DevkitPPC toolchain, libogc, all SDL2-wii libraries, and [libromfs-ogc.](https://github.com/NateXS/libromfs-ogc).
-   **For the GameCube**, you need the DevkitPPC toolchain, libogc, all SDL2-gamecube libraries, and [libromfs-ogc.](https://github.com/NateXS/libromfs-ogc).
-   **For the Switch**, you need the DevkitA64 toolchain, libnx, and all SDL2-switch libraries.
-   **For the Vita**, all you need is the [vitasdk](https://vitasdk.org) toolchain. It includes every SDL2 thing you might need.
-   **For the PSP**, all you need is the [PSPSDK](https://pspdev.github.io) toolchain. It includes every SDL2 thing you might need.
-   **For the PS4**, you will need the [OpenOrbis](https://github.com/OpenOrbis/OpenOrbis-PS4-Toolchain) toolchain, [PacBrew](https://github.com/PacBrew/ps4-openorbis-portlibs) portlibs which include SDL2, and our [fixed packages](https://github.com/gradylink/pacbrew-packages).

> [!NOTE]
> DevkitPro's install instructions are available at: https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started

Download the source code from the releases tab and unzip it.

Make a `romfs` folder inside the unzipped source code and put the Scratch project inside of that.

-   The Scratch project MUST be named `project.sb3`, all lowercase.
-   For faster load times/less limitations, you can also unzip the sb3 project file and put the contents into a new folder called `project`.

Then you need to compile the projects into proper Homebrew packages.

-   **For the 3DS**, you simply need to run `make`. Then copy the `Scratch-3DS.3dsx` file like you normally would.
-   **For the Wii U**, you need to run `make PLATFORM=wiiu` and then copy the `build/wiiu/scratch-wiiu` folder into the `sdcard:/wiiu/apps` folder on your sd card.
-   **For the Wii**, you need to run `make PLATFORM=wii package`, then find the zipped file in `build/wii/scratch-wii.zip`. Unzip it and put the `apps` folder inside the root of your Wii SD card.
-   **For the GameCube**, you need to run `make PLATFORM=gamecube`, then find the `.dol` file at `build/gamecube/scratch-gamecube.dol`.
-   **For the Switch**, you need to run `make PLATFORM=switch`, then find the `.nro` file at `build/switch/scratch-nx.nro`.
-   **For the Vita**, run `make PLATFORM=vita`, then transfer the VPK at `build/vita/scratch-vita.vpk` over to your Vita.
-   **For the PSP**, run `psp-cmake -B build/psp -S . -DSE_SYSTEM=ON -DSE_CLOUDVARS=OFF && make -C build/psp`, then unzip the `scratch-psp.zip` file at `build/psp` and transfer the `scratch-psp` folder over to your PSP.
-   **For the PS4**, you will need to run `make PLATFORM=ps4`, then find the `.pkg` file at `build/ps4/scratch-ps4.pkg`.

#### Compilation Flags

> [!WARNING]
> We are currently migrating our build system from standalone Makefiles to a centralized `CMakeLists.txt` so documentation in this section might be outdated.

Compilation flags are used to select which features will be enabled in the compiled version of Scratch Everywhere!. To use a compilation flag simply add it to the end of the make command (e.g. `make ENABLE_LOADSCREEN=0`).

-   `ENABLE_LOADSCREEN` (default: `1`): If set to `1`, the loading screen is enabled, if set to `0` the screen is simply black during that time.
-   `ENABLE_AUDIO` (default: `1`): If set to `1`, Audio will be enabled. If set to `0`, it will be disabled.
-   `ENABLE_CLOUDVARS` (default: `0`): If set to `1`, cloud variable support is enabled, if set to `0` cloud variables are treated like normal variables. If your project doesn't use cloud variables, it is recommended to leave this turned off. If you run into errors while building try turning this off and see if that fixes the errors.
-   **[Old 3DS]** `RAM_AMOUNT` (default: `72`): the amount of RAM, in megabytes, the old 3DS should be using. Can be set to `32`, `64`, `72`, `80`, or `96`.
